# Class methods don't need objects to be instanciated when used. A class method 
# is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.

# They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter 
# that points to the class and not the object instance.

# It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. 
# For example it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.
